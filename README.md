# Sorting-Algorithms
Various Sorting Algorithms
- The main.cpp file tests the sorting algorithms by making a copy of an inputted int array and string array (the original one) and then running the function using the copy and    printing the output.

- The sort.hpp contains the "#include" for the other header files

- The sorting algorithms are put into their own cpp file and a corresponding header file is created and added to sot.hpp

- If you do make a change to a file, or add a file, please put your name in the "Author" section after any existing name
